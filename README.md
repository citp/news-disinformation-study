# Web Science
A research project on how web users consume, are exposed to, and share news. Also, we hope, a library and template for [Firefox Pioneer](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-firefox-pioneer) studies.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS
* [Mozilla web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)

## Running the Extension
Launch an instance of Firefox with a temporary profile using `web-ext run` in the extension directory.

## Debugging the Extension
Debugging output is available in Tools → Web Developer → Browser Console. Make sure that the Show Content Messages option is checked. You might find it helpful to set a filter for debugging messages of interest. You can also download the set of measurements currently in storage by clicking the Princeton icon in the toolbar.
