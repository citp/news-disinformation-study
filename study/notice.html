    <h2>Political and COVID-19 News Information Flows Study Privacy Notice</h2>

    <p>October 30, 2020</p>

    <p>This Study is offered by Mozilla and researchers at Princeton University to conduct academic research about political and COVID-19 news information flows across websites and online services. </p>

    <p>The goal of this study is to understand how web users are exposed to, consume, and share these types of information, which can inform efforts to distinguish trustworthy and untrustworthy content.</p>

    <h3>What Information We Collect:</h3>

    <p>This Study collects data in two ways (1) through the Study add-on and; (2) through optional surveys offered by Princeton. The section below describes how these two parts work.</p>

    <h4>The Study add-on</h4>

    <p>When you join this study, Mozilla will automatically install the study add-on to your browser.  The following data will be collected through the add-on.</p>

    <p><strong>Browsing data</strong>: When you browse the web, Mozilla will collect general information about the sites you visit. This will not include the full URL of the pages, but does include the domain and subdomain name of certain websites related to political and COVID-19 news—like foxnews.com, cooking.nytimes.com, or cdc.gov. We will also collect information about the time of day you access a site, how long you spend on a given site, how many different pages you load on that site, and what sources or websites led you to that site.</p>

    <p><strong>Social media data</strong>: When you visit a news outlet’s social media account, Mozilla will collect general information about the visit. This information does not include what content you viewed, but does include the name of the social media account, like @nytimes or @FoxNews on Twitter. We will also collect general information when you share content from a news outlet to Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit, and the audience you shared it with (e.g., public or restricted). We won’t know exactly what you shared or who you shared it to, only that you shared a link from a news source and to an audience.</p>

    <p>Read the full data collection documentation here: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/news-disinformation-study/tree/master/schemas">https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/news-disinformation-study/tree/master/schemas</a></p>

    <h4>The Study survey</h4>

    <p>The Princeton research team will also offer you the opportunity to participate in a separate survey, if you would like to provide more information for this research. Princeton runs the survey and it is subject to Princeton’s IRB Consent Form. The survey is optional.</p>

    <p>Princeton will share the survey data with Mozilla so that the add-on and survey data can be evaluated together.</p>

    <p><strong>Demographic data</strong>: If you complete a Princeton-administered Survey, Mozilla will receive a copy of your responses including your demographic information; like your age, gender, education level, voter registration status, income, political affiliation, and digital literacy.</p>

    <p><strong>Media behavior data</strong>: If you complete a Princeton-administered Survey, Mozilla will receive a copy of your responses including your media use and preferences; like how often you watch or read the news, whether you trust it, and what sources you get your news from.</p>

    <h3>Who We May Share  Information with:</h3>

    <p><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong>: We use GCP as our cloud-storage service. Mozilla has contracted with GCP requiring them to handle the data in ways that are approved by us.</p>

    <p><strong>Princeton University</strong>: The data collected in this Study will be shared with Princeton University for the purposes of carrying out the academic research. </p>

    <p><strong>General public</strong>: The results of this Study may be published. Additionally, data sets from this Study may be released. If we do so, we will aggregate the data and remove identifying information, so the data won’t reveal the behaviors or characteristics of individual users. </p>

    <h3>Data Management:</h3>

    <p>You can unenroll in the active study at any time by pressing the “Leave Study” button on the about:ion page in Firefox. When you unenroll from the study, we will treat this as a request to delete your data. </p>

    <p>Once the study is closed, Mozilla will automatically remove the study add-on from your browser and you will no longer be able to delete the data you’ve contributed to the study. This protects the integrity of the research.  If you would like to delete your data, please do so before the study closes. You may also need to take additional steps to delete the survey data that Princeton holds, please reach out to Princeton for more information at (<a href="mailto:covid-19-study@lists.cs.princeton.edu">covid-19-study@lists.cs.princeton.edu</a>).</p>

    <h2>Your informed consent is being sought for research.</h2>
    <h2>Participation in the research is voluntary.</h2>
  
    <h3>Academic Institution</h3>
    <p>Princeton University</p>
  
    <h3>Study Name</h3>
    <p>COVID-19 and Political Information Flows</p>
  
    <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
    <p>Jonathan Mayer, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs</p>
  
    <h3>IRB Approval</h3>
    <p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Princeton University.</p>
  
    <h3>Study Purpose</h3>
    <p>The study assesses hows individuals are exposed to, consuming, sharing, and acting on health and political information and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  
    <h3>Study Benefits to Society</h3>
    <p>This study will help identify information distribution pathways for truthful and inaccurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these pathways is crucial to designing public health interventions and addressing online misinformation.</p>
  
    <h3>Study Procedures</h3>
    <p>During the study, your browser will automatically send data to Mozilla about how you engage with health and news websites, in addition to standard Firefox telemetry. We have taken a number of steps to minimize and protect this data, which we describe below. You may also be asked to participate in periodic surveys. If you choose to provide demographic for Pioneer research purposes, that information will also be used for this study.</p>
  
    <p>Your participation in the study will conclude when data collection is completed or, if you choose to discontinue participation, when you make that choice. Data collection will last no longer than 6 months.</p>
  
    <h3>Leaving the Study</h3>
    <p>You can leave the study at any time from the Pioneer preferences page (about:pioneer) and clicking “Leave Study.” When you leave the study, the study’s browser extension will be automatically uninstalled, removing both the study code and data. You will not be able to rejoin the study if you leave. If you turn off Pioneer, you will also leave the study.</p>
  
    <h3>Study Risks and Alternative Procedures</h3>
    <p>There is minimal risk associated with participating in the study. There are no alternative means of participating in the study that may be advantageous to you.</p>
  
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>We will protect the information that you provide in several ways: minimizing the data we collect, keeping the data we collect secure, and limiting the information we use and disclose.</p>
  
    <p><em>Data minimization:</em> We will limit our data collection to information needed to carry out our study. We
    will not collect your name, email address, or similar contact information. We also will make no effort to identify you on the basis of information you provide. When collecting data about your web browsing, we
    will use coarse and aggregate measures as much as possible. For instance, when collecting data about
    your visit to a webpage, we will only collect a time window in which the event occurred instead of the
    exact time, and we will only collect the domain name and page type for the webpage rather than the full
    URL. We will also only collect activity specific to a website if we have previously categorized the
    website as health or news related.</p>
  
    <p><em>Data security:</em> We will encrypt the data that you provide both in transit and at rest. We will only allow
    access to Princeton researchers and Mozilla personnel who have specific responsibilities in carrying out
    the study.</p>
  
    <p><em>Data use and disclosure:</em> We will only use the data you provide to carry out this academic study. We will
    not disclose information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
  
    <h3>Compensation</h3>
    <p>There is no compensation for participation in this study.</p>
  
    <h3>Who to Contact with Questions</h3>
