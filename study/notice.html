  <h2>Your informed consent is being sought for research.</h2>
  <h2>Participation in the research is voluntary.</h2>

  <h3>Academic Institution</h3>
  <p>Princeton University</p>

  <h3>Study Name</h3>
  <p>COVID-19 and Political Information Flows</p>

  <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
  <p>Jonathan Mayer, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs</p>

  <h3>IRB Approval</h3>
  <p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Princeton University.</p>

  <h3>Study Purpose</h3>
  <p>The study assesses hows individuals are exposed to, consuming, sharing, and acting on health and political information and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <h3>Study Benefits to Society</h3>
  <p>This study will help identify information distribution pathways for truthful and inaccurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these pathways is crucial to designing public health interventions and addressing online misinformation.</p>

  <h3>Study Procedures</h3>
  <p>During the study, your browser will automatically send data to Mozilla about how you engage with health and news websites, in addition to standard Firefox telemetry. We have taken a number of steps to minimize and protect this data, which we describe below. You may also be asked to participate in periodic surveys. If you choose to provide demographic for Pioneer research purposes, that information will also be used for this study.</p>

  <p>Your participation in the study will conclude when data collection is completed or, if you choose to discontinue participation, when you make that choice. Data collection will last no longer than 6 months.</p>

  <h3>Leaving the Study</h3>
  <p>You can leave the study at any time from the Pioneer preferences page (about:pioneer) and clicking “Leave Study.” When you leave the study, the study’s browser extension will be automatically uninstalled, removing both the study code and data. You will not be able to rejoin the study if you leave. If you turn off Pioneer, you will also leave the study.</p>

  <h3>Study Risks and Alternative Procedures</h3>
  <p>There is minimal risk associated with participating in the study. There are no alternative means of participating in the study that may be advantageous to you.</p>

  <h3>Privacy</h3>
  <p>We will protect the information that you provide in several ways: minimizing the data we collect, keeping the data we collect secure, and limiting the information we use and disclose.</p>

  <p><em>Data minimization:</em> We will limit our data collection to information needed to carry out our study. We
  will not collect your name, email address, or similar contact information. We also will make no effort to identify you on the basis of information you provide. When collecting data about your web browsing, we
  will use coarse and aggregate measures as much as possible. For instance, when collecting data about
  your visit to a webpage, we will only collect a time window in which the event occurred instead of the
  exact time, and we will only collect the domain name and page type for the webpage rather than the full
  URL. We will also only collect activity specific to a website if we have previously categorized the
  website as health or news related.</p>

  <p><em>Data security:</em> We will encrypt the data that you provide both in transit and at rest. We will only allow
  access to Princeton researchers and Mozilla personnel who have specific responsibilities in carrying out
  the study.</p>

  <p><em>Data use and disclosure:</em> We will only use the data you provide to carry out this academic study. We will
  not disclose information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you.</p>

  <h3>Compensation</h3>
  <p>There is no compensation for participation in this study.</p>

  feel you can discuss with the Investigator, please contact the Institutional Review Board for Human
